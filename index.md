Hello! I am TJ Gillis. 

For the past 15 years I've worked on projects ranging from Flash multiplayer games to award winning iOS apps. Currently I am a Generalist Programmer for Ubisoft, focusing on Unity3d and DevOps.

You can find me all over the internet but to the left you'll find a few links where I am most active.
